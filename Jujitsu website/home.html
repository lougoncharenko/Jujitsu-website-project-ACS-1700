            <p>Hello! My name is Louisa and I am a Software Engineer who enjoys being active. When i'm not coding
                I am spending my time either training or staying active. I am currently a white belt in Jujitsu 
                and have been training for about 6 months.

            <h2>Why I started training jujitsu</h2>
            <p>I started training Jujitsu on June 2021. I was just getting out of an abusive relationship 
                where I had gained over 30 pounds of weight and was struggling with my mental health. For me, 
                fitness was always an escape and a way I disciplined myself. Fitness gave me the structure 
                I needed to heal physically, emotionally and mentally.

            <h2>What is Jujitsu?</h2>
            <p>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a martial art sport that takes place on the ground.  Unlike other martial arts, Brazilian Jujitsu does not 
                use strikes and/or kicks rather jiu jitsu athletes focus on close-contact “grappling” holds and techniques. The goal of Brazillian Jujitsu
                is to submit your oppenent in a non-violent nature using chokes and joint-manipulations. Brazillian Jujitsu using the knowledge of human 
                anatomy, leverage, time and pressure to effectively grapple.</p>

            <h2>Why practice Jujitsu?</h2>
            <p>Like most sports, Jujitsu offers both physical and mental benefits.</p>

            <p>Jujitsu provides many physical benefits because it combines mobility, explosive movements, cardio and strength.
                Jujitsu helps develops increased strength and cardiovascularity as well as promotes weight loss or maintenance 
                and improves muscle tones. Due to the fact that you’re constantly responding to another person’s movements, 
                jiu jitsu heightens your body awareness and improves your balance and reactive ability.</p>

            <p>Jujitsu is an incredible mental workout. The sport challenges your mind by requiring you to learn a new activity
                and all the movement, techniques and submissions that come along with it. Jujitsu has often been compared to a 
                chess game, in the sense that you are always thinking ahead and creating strategies based on your opponent's 
                movements. Jujitsu trains you to think quickly while remaining calm and controlled even when you are put in a 
            defensive situation.</p>
