        <h2>Importance of stretching and Mobility</h2>
        <p>Each training session begins with stretching and mobility training. Before starting Jujitsu, I 
            never used to stretch or focus on mobility training. Once I started grappling, I quickly noticed 
            that without the mobility and fexibility, I was at a disadvantage. Since practicing the sport, my 
            flexibility has increased due to the specific movements I have been incorportating. Flexibility 
            and stretching play an important role Brazilian Jujitsu for the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Helps you control your body allowing you to perform techniques quicker and more precisely. </li>
            <li>Helps prevent injuries </li>
            <li>Improves physical performance </li>
            <li>Reduces muscular and joint pain </li>
            <li>Helps relax the body </li>
            <li>Provides more blood and nutrients to the muscles</li>
        </ul>

                <h2>Strength Training and Cardio </h2>
                <p>I currently train between 4-5 days a week at Jujitsu. When I'm not at my training gym, I supplement
                 with cardio such as biking, jump rope, battle ropes, boxing, and jogging for conditioning. I put myself 
                 through conditioning workouts involving kettlebells and body weight workout to improve my athleticism. 
                 I also lift weights to build strength 5 times per week following a Push, Pull, and Legs split</p>
