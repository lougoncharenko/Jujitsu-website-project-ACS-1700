           <h1>Nutrition and Recovery</h1>

           <h2>Why is nutrition important for Jujitsu?</h2>
           <p> Being that Jujitsu is a demanding sport, nutrition plays an important role in 
               fueling the body and aiding in recovery. Just like with any other sports, Jujitsu 
               athletes gain a competitive edge when they focus on fueling their body with nutritious
               foods that are full of vitamins and minerals. I have found that eating nutrient dense 
               foods has helped me remain light on my feet and has given me greater focus. Once I started 
               training, I cut out fried foods, processed foods, sugary drinks and even alcohol as consuming
               such things caused me to feel sluggish and tired. I have learned that I perform best when I eat
               well. 
           </p>

           <h2>Proper Hydration</h2>
           <p>Staying hydrated is probably the single-most important thing any athlete can do. Jujtisu athletes
               are sweating throughout their workouts and need to be replenishing all the fluids they lose during 
               sessions. I usually bring a liter of water to my training sessions and can drink the whole container
               during my workout. Being properly hydrated allows me to focus on my techniques and strategy whereas, 
               when I am thirsty, often my performance suffers. Being hydrated helps regulate body temperature and
               lubriacates the joints, two things that are vital to staying alert and agile while grappling. Being
               dehydrated puts Jujitsu athletes at risk for muscles cramps, dizziness and fatigue. 
           </p>

           <h2> Recovery techniques for Jujitsu</h2>
           <p>Pushing your body to the limit as one does in Jujitsu is strenous on the muscles and joints. To prevent
               injuries and to recover properly, I have developed some handy tools that I use to recover after my 
               training sessions. The tips I have for recovering properly include:
               <ol>
                   <li>Stretch before and after a training session</li>
                   <li>Get to class early to do a light warm up of the muscles via cardio</li>
                   <li>Drink plenty of water before, during and after the session</li>
                   <li>Get a good amount of rest and sleep during the day (8-10 hours</li>
                   <li>take a rest day if your body is tired or injured.</li>
                   <li>Eat a nutritious diet to help muscle tissue recover</li>
                   <li>Use ice baths and saunasas needed.</li>
               </ol>
